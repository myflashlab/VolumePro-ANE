This demo apk is built with shared runtime but nothing can stop you from building your own final product in captive mode!
We used shared packaging just because the final size of the .apk is much smaller and it will be easier for people to download
the github project.

Shared compiled .apk files will run only if the official Adobe Air app is installed on your device.
